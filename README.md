# Module 11 Assignment - UFOs

## Background
Dana approached us for assistance with her web-site, an online database of UFO sightings, in an attempt to make it more user friendly by adding a filter feature. This feature will allow users to narrow the database shown by filtering based on the following criteria (and current database fields):

- The Date of a sighting
- The City, State and/or Country of the sighting
- The Shape of the UFO seen in the sighting. 

## Performing a Search
The process one must use in order to utilize this new search feature is quite simple. First, the user must decide what fields they would like to search by, or, at the very least, decide on a field to start with. For our example, we will start with the State field (note that we have listed out the following steps and have included screenshots of the website to assist you).

1. Scroll down to the table at the bottom of the web page and locate the field you would like to filter by first on the left-hand side. We have located the "Enter State" field and will start by inputting the desired filter into the text box below the "Enter State" text.

2. Next, use the placeholder text initially in the text box to guide your search. For the "Enter State" field it notes "2 letter state code." Therefore, if we want to search by a state we need to input using that specific format. For this example, we will search for sightings in California state by inputting "ca" into the text box. 

3. In order to initiate the filter, either press enter on your keyboard or click outside of the text box. The page will automatically update the table to only include sightings with the state code that you entered. Notice in the example below that all the data shown in the table has the state code "ca".

4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 for any additional fields that you would like to filter by. In the example below, we are adding filters for the UFO shape "light" and search only on the date "1/9/2010". This has narrowed the table to one input, shown below.

5. To clear the table filters and restore the table to its initial state, use the refresh button on your web browser.


## Conclusion
While the current design is very helpful in allowing for a more detailed search (as opposed to the previous version of the website that only allowed you to search based on date), it is far from perfect. 

One drawback of the current design is that it has removed the search button that generates the filters. This may be annoying for people who want to input multiple filters and don't want the site and table to refresh with each individual filter. It may be worth re-introducing the search button or even allow people to choose when the search is initiated (i.e., add a "automatic search" switch that can either be set to "on" or "off"). 

In addition to the current design's drawback, there are additional features that may be helpful for users. These recommendation for future versions can be found below:

- The current layout only allows the search criteria to be inputted using one format (e.g., lower case text for city, state, country, and shape). Adding flexibility in how a user inputs the inputs would be helpful.
- Giving the user options of possible inputs would also be helpful to avoid having users run the program and get zero results. This could be in the form of the drop down that appears below the test box showing the possible searches one can use. 

Adding these features would take this site to a new level and draw more user world-wide.
